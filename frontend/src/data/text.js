        diseaseName:"Peripheral Arterial Disease",
        diseaseDescription:"Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD) is a common circulatory condition in which narrowing of the arteries reduces blood flow to arms, legs and other parts of the body. It is caused by a build-up of fatty deposits, including cholesterol, in the arteries that supply blood to the legs and feet. Over time, PAD can lead to pain, numbness, and even gangrene in the affected areas.",
        diseaseReccomendation:"A person at risk of peripheral arterial disease should take steps to reduce their risk factors, such as quitting smoking, maintaining a healthy weight, exercising regularly, and eating a diet rich in fruits and vegetables. Additionally, they should visit their doctor regularly to monitor their blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood sugar levels, and discuss with their doctor any other lifestyle modifications they can make to reduce their risk. They should also be aware of the signs and symptoms of peripheral arterial disease, and seek medical attention immediately if they experience any of these symptoms."

        diseaseName:"Thoracic aortic Aneurysms",
        diseaseDescription:"Thoracic aortic aneurysms are a serious medical condition where the aorta, the largest artery in the body, balloons out and becomes weakened. This can cause a tear in the artery wall as well as a rupture, both of which can be fatal if not treated quickly. Treatment for thoracic aortic aneurysms often involves open surgery to repair the aneurysm or to replace the weakened section of the aorta.",
        diseaseReccomendation:"A recommendation for someone at risk of thoracic aortic aneurysms is to seek medical attention immediately if they experience any symptoms.

        diseaseName:"Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm",
        diseaseDescription:"Abdominal aortic aneurysm is a bulge or ballooning in the aorta, the major blood vessel that carries blood from the heart to the rest of the body. It is caused by a weakening of the blood vessel wall which can result in a rupture if left untreated. Abdominal aortic aneurysms are usually treated with surgery to prevent life-threatening bleeding.",
        diseaseReccomendation:"If you are at risk for an abdominal aortic aneurysm, it is important for you to seek a physician's  monitoring. It is recommended that they have regular checkups with their doctor and have imaging tests such as an ultrasound or CT scan to monitor the size of the aneurysm. If the aneurysm is found to be growing, it may be necessary for them to have surgery to repair or replace the aorta. Additionally, it is important for them to make lifestyle changes to reduce their risk of the aneurysm rupturing. This includes quitting smoking, eating a healthy diet, maintaining a healthy weight, exercising regularly, and controlling any underlying conditions such as hypertension or diabetes."
